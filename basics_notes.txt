// This is a basics notes file.

1. React components are mostly written in JavaScript ES6 with JSX syntax (a syntax extension to JavaScript).
2. Browsers can understand some parts of ES6, but not all.
3. Broswers have no idea about what JSX is and how to run that.
In that case, in order to run our React code in the browser, 
you have to do some transformation work, to make the browser understand the code.

Babel:
    a compiler for writing next generation JavaScript.
    a tool that helps you write code in the latest version of JavaScript. 
    When your supported environments don't support certain features natively, 
    Babel will help you compile those features down to a supported version.
    
webpack:
    a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications.
    1. by asynchronously loading modules and running them when they have finished loading, 
    2. or by combining all of the necessary files into a single JavaScript file 
       that would be loaded via a <script> tag in the HTML.
